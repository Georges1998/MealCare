# MealCare Front-End

This is the front-end directory.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running for the mobile front-end development on your local machine.

### Flutter Installation

The frontend framework used is Flutter, which allows us to compile once for all mobile environments.

First, download the Flutter SDK from here. 

```
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
```

Be sure to install the SDK globally, and not in the project folder. On a Windows machine you could create a directory in C:\ but avoid installing it in Program Files. Equivalently on a Mac it can be anywhere.

```
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
```

Next, you can download Android Studio from here. You can use your own preferred text editor as well, but Android Studio is generally preferred.

```
https://developer.android.com/studio
```

Alternatively, Xcode is needed for iOS development. You can install this from the App Store.
