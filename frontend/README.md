# MealCare Front-End

This is the front-end directory.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running for the mobile front-end development on your local machine.

### Flutter Installation

This installation follows the following outlines.
```
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
```

Requirements
```
400 MB free space for Windows
2.8 GB free space for MacOS
```
No clue why there's such a big difference.

First, download the Flutter SDK.

Be sure to install the SDK globally, and not in the project folder. On a Windows machine you could create a directory in ```C:\```. Avoid installing it in Program Files. Equivalently on a Mac it can be anywhere, but a good directory is in :/Library.

```
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
```

Afterwards you need to add the ```flutter``` tool to your path.

```
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

This however only adds it to the current terminal window. If you wish to add it permanently for ease of use, run this instead.

```

```
### Choosing your IDE

Next, you can download Android Studio from here. You can use your own preferred text editor as well, but Android Studio is generally preferred.

```

```

Alternatively, Xcode is needed for iOS development. You can install this from the App Store.

### Getting familiar with Dart

The best way to learn is from the source.
